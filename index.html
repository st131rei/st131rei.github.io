        <p>I love coffee so much that I make it with my own hands almost every day.In this site, I would like to introduce three coffees that I recommend.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Nicaragua French Roast</li>
                <p>This is first and foremost a clean coffee with a sweet, chestnut-like aftertaste.</p>
                <li>Ethiopian Mocha City Roast</li>
                <p>This is the best coffee bean without saying.Although it is generally considered to be characterized by its acidity, the deep roast gives it a chocolate-like flavor.</p>
                <li>Indonesia Mandarin French Roast</li>
                <p>Mandarin is a variety characterized by a heavy bitterness. This bean, which undergoes a traditional selection called Sumatra style, sometimes has a spicy flavor. It is a great bean to pair with sweetness, as an accompaniment to cigarettes, or as a latte.</p>
            </ol>
